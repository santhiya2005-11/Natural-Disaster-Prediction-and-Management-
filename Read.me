Natural Disaster Prediction and Management System

Abstract

The AI-Based Natural Disaster Prediction and Management System aims to enhance disaster preparedness and response by leveraging artificial intelligence, satellite imagery analysis, historical data patterns, and real-time sensor inputs. In its final phase, the system integrates advanced machine learning models to predict disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and cyclones, while providing early warnings and actionable insights to authorities and the public. This document offers a comprehensive summary of the project completion, including system demonstration, technical documentation, performance analysis, source code, and testing outcomes. The platform is scalable, secure, and designed to seamlessly integrate with government emergency alert systems.
